description: invalid spec that shows an invalid resource specifier for `get` using spaces to indicate multiple resources
require:
  - kind
tests:
  - kube:
      # a resource specifier is either a resource kind or alias, e.g. "pods" or
      # "po", or a string in the form of "{kind}/{name}". Spaces and commas are
      # not allowed in a resource identifier and only a single forward slash is
      # permitted, indicating the boundary between kind and name.
      get: pods events
